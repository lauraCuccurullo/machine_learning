I developed my progect with matlab.

I used 2 datasets, one of fraud credit and the other of skin colour.

The data set of fraud credit is available here : https://drive.google.com/open?id=1HJuILC9uDifutBfZcPAlr4F7qfoL5_BZ

I have implemented ID3 algorithm for building a tree. 

Each folders contains a variation of the ID3 algorithm, with a different number of children.

Last 2 folders use matlab's own implementation of trees, in order to compare it to my algorithm.
